# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & CI/CD Setup

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Product Owner,
**I want** the project monorepo and a basic CI/CD pipeline to be set up,
**so that** we have a stable, automated foundation for development and deployment from day one.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A monorepo is created and initialized with a basic folder structure for the backend and frontend applications.
2. A "Health Check" endpoint exists on the backend that returns a 200 OK status.

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story establishes the foundational infrastructure based on the comprehensive architecture documented in the sharded architecture files.

### Technology Stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js (~14.x) with App Router
- **Backend Framework:** Next.js API Routes (serverless functions)
- **Language:** TypeScript (~5.x) with strict mode enabled
- **Build System:** Turborepo (~1.x) for monorepo orchestration
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (16.x) with Prisma ORM (~5.x)
- **Deployment Platform:** Vercel with Edge Network
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions integrated with Vercel deployment
- **Authentication:** Auth.js/NextAuth (~5.x)

### Project Structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
The monorepo structure must follow the exact layout specified:
```
emma-companionship/
├── apps/web/                     # Next.js fullstack application
├── packages/
│   ├── shared-types/            # TypeScript interfaces
│   ├── ui/                      # shadcn/ui components
│   └── config/                  # Shared configuration
├── .github/workflows/           # CI/CD workflows
├── scripts/                     # Build and deployment scripts
└── docs/                        # Project documentation
```

### Health Check API Endpoint [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
Create `/api/health` endpoint that returns:
```typescript
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-19T...",
  "environment": "development",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]
The GitHub Actions workflow must include:
- **Test Job:** PostgreSQL service, dependency installation, linting, type checking
- **Preview Deployment:** Automatic deployment on PR with preview URL commenting
- **Production Deployment:** Deployment on main branch merge with health checks
- **Environment Variables:** Proper secret management for different environments

### Development Workflow [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
Must support the following commands:
- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm lint` - Code linting
- `pnpm type-check` - TypeScript validation
- `pnpm db:generate` - Prisma client generation

### Coding Standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
Critical rules to enforce from the start:
- **TypeScript Strict Mode:** Enable strict flag, forbid `any` type
- **Import Organization:** Use absolute imports with `@/` prefix
- **Environment Variables:** Never access `process.env` directly in application code
- **Module Boundaries:** Enforce through ESLint rules
- **Code Formatting:** Prettier with pre-commit hooks

### File Locations

- **Next.js App:** `apps/web/src/app/` (App Router structure)
- **API Routes:** `apps/web/src/app/api/health/route.ts`
- **CI/CD:** `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
- **Database:** `apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Docker:** `docker-compose.yml` (root level)

## Testing

### Testing Strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Organization:** Co-located tests with `.test.ts/.test.tsx` suffix
- **Fixtures:** Store in `__tests__/fixtures/` directories
- **Framework:** Jest + React Testing Library for frontend, Supertest for API routes
- **CI Integration:** Tests run automatically in GitHub Actions with PostgreSQL service

### Required Tests for This Story
- Health check endpoint test (`apps/web/src/app/api/health/route.test.ts`)
- Basic page rendering tests
- Build process validation
- Environment configuration validation

### Test Commands
- `pnpm test` - Run all tests

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2024-12-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** SOLID FOUNDATION with Critical Security Gaps

The infrastructure implementation demonstrates excellent architectural decisions and follows established patterns. The monorepo structure is well-organized, TypeScript configuration is strict and comprehensive, and the CI/CD pipeline provides robust automation. However, **critical security vulnerabilities** must be addressed before production deployment.

**Strengths:**
- Clean separation of concerns with workspace packages
- Comprehensive error handling in health API
- Proper TypeScript strict mode enforcement
- Well-structured Next.js App Router implementation
- Solid CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive checks

**Critical Issues:**
- Hardcoded admin credentials in authentication system
- Missing Content Security Policy headers
- No rate limiting implementation
- Insufficient test coverage (5% vs 80-90% target)

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed during this review due to security vulnerabilities requiring developer attention and architectural decisions about authentication strategy.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards:** ✓ PASS - TypeScript strict mode, ESLint rules, Prettier formatting all properly configured
- **Project Structure:** ✓ PASS - Follows unified project structure specification exactly
- **Testing Strategy:** ✗ CONCERNS - Framework properly configured but implementation severely lacking (1 test file vs 19 source files)
- **All ACs Met:** ✓ PASS - All 4 acceptance criteria technically implemented, though with security concerns

### Improvements Checklist

**CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Production:**
- [ ] Remove hardcoded admin password from auth.ts (security vulnerability)
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy headers as per architecture requirements
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware (100 req/min authenticated, 20 req/min anonymous)
- [ ] Configure proper CORS policy for production domains

**HIGH Priority - Address Before Next Story:**
- [ ] Implement comprehensive authentication test suite
- [ ] Add integration tests for database operations
- [ ] Add security headers validation tests
- [ ] Implement proper password hashing strategy

**MEDIUM Priority - Technical Debt:**
- [ ] Increase test coverage to meet architecture targets (90% business logic)
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and validation
- [ ] Implement TanStack Query for client-side caching
- [ ] Add database indexes to Prisma schema

**LOW Priority - Future Enhancement:**
- [ ] Add bundle size monitoring and optimization
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging strategy
- [ ] Add accessibility testing framework
- [ ] Consider implementing service worker for offline capability

### Security Review

**CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED:**

1. **Hardcoded Credentials** (HIGH SEVERITY)
   - Location: `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts:74`
   - Issue: Admin password 'admin123' hardcoded in source code
   - Risk: Complete authentication bypass possible
   - **BLOCKS PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

2. **Missing Content Security Policy** (HIGH SEVERITY)
   - Required by architecture: Strict CSP headers
   - Current: Basic security headers only
   - Risk: XSS and code injection vulnerabilities
   - **BLOCKS PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

3. **No Rate Limiting** (HIGH SEVERITY)
   - Required by architecture: 100 req/min auth, 20 req/min anon
   - Current: No rate limiting implemented
   - Risk: Brute force and DoS attacks
   - **BLOCKS PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

**Implemented Security Measures:**
- Basic security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, HSTS)
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- JWT session strategy with HTTP-only cookies
- Environment variable configuration via type-safe config

### Performance Considerations

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✓ Next.js App Router with Server Components (reduces client-side JS)
- ✓ TypeScript strict mode for optimization
- ✗ No response time validation (target: P95 < 200ms)
- ✗ No bundle size monitoring (target: 250KB main bundle)
- ✗ No database indexing strategy
- ✗ No client-side caching (TanStack Query missing)

**Performance testing and monitoring framework needs implementation.**

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified during this review. Critical security issues require architectural decisions and comprehensive fixes that should be handled by the development team.

### Gate Status

Trace matrix: docs/qa/assessments/1.1-trace-20241219.md  

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - Critical Security Issues Must Be Addressed**

**Rationale:** While the infrastructure foundation is excellently architected and all acceptance criteria are functionally met, **critical security vulnerabilities** prevent production readiness. The hardcoded admin credentials, missing CSP headers, and lack of rate limiting create unacceptable security risks.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate:** Address critical security vulnerabilities
2. **Before Next Story:** Implement comprehensive authentication testing
3. **Ongoing:** Systematically improve test coverage to meet architecture targets

**Note:** The foundational architecture and implementation quality is exceptional. Once security issues are resolved, this provides a solid platform for future development.
