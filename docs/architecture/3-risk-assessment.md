# 3. RISK ASSESSMENT

**Risk Level: MINIMAL** ðŸŸ¢

All traditional architecture risks have been properly mitigated:

1. **Technology Lock-in** (LOW RISK) - Mitigated through vendor-neutral patterns
2. **Scalability Limitations** (LOW RISK) - Addressed with Vercel Edge + horizontal scaling
3. **Security Vulnerabilities** (MINIMAL RISK) - Comprehensive security controls implemented
4. **Performance Bottlenecks** (LOW RISK) - Specific optimization strategies defined
5. **Integration Complexity** (MINIMAL RISK) - Clear integration patterns established
