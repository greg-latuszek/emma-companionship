**Coverage Gap**: No explicit test of Turborepo orchestration or workspace isolation

---

#### DR7: Security headers and API protection

**Coverage: NONE**

**Coverage Gap**: No test validating security headers in Next.js config or Vercel config

---

#### DR8: Docker database setup and development environment

**Coverage: NONE** 

**Coverage Gap**: No test validating Docker Compose setup or database initialization

---

### Critical Gaps Analysis

#### High Priority Gaps

1. **Authentication System (DR3)**
   - **Risk**: High - Authentication is critical for security
   - **Impact**: User access control completely untested
   - **Recommendation**: Add unit tests for auth configuration and integration tests for sign-in flow

2. **Security Headers (DR7)**
   - **Risk**: High - Security vulnerability exposure
   - **Impact**: Potential XSS, CSRF, and other attacks
   - **Recommendation**: Add tests validating security header implementation

3. **Database Integration (DR2)**
   - **Risk**: Medium-High - Data layer foundation
   - **Impact**: Database connectivity and migration issues
   - **Recommendation**: Add dedicated database connection and Prisma integration tests

#### Medium Priority Gaps

4. **Pre-commit Hooks (DR4)**
   - **Risk**: Medium - Code quality enforcement
   - **Impact**: Poor code quality could slip through
   - **Recommendation**: Add test validating pre-commit hook execution

5. **Environment Configuration (DR5)**
   - **Risk**: Medium - Configuration validation
   - **Impact**: Runtime errors from invalid configuration
   - **Recommendation**: Add comprehensive environment variable validation tests

6. **CI/CD Pipeline Validation (AC3, AC4)**
   - **Risk**: Medium - Deployment reliability
   - **Impact**: Broken deployments or CI failures
   - **Recommendation**: Add end-to-end CI/CD validation tests

#### Lower Priority Gaps

7. **Docker Environment (DR8)**
   - **Risk**: Low-Medium - Development environment setup
   - **Impact**: Developer onboarding issues
   - **Recommendation**: Add automated Docker environment validation

8. **Monorepo Structure Validation (AC1)**
   - **Risk**: Low - Project structure integrity
   - **Impact**: Build or dependency issues
   - **Recommendation**: Add test validating workspace configuration

### Test Design Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Authentication Test Suite**
   ```typescript
   // apps/web/src/lib/auth.test.ts
   // Test NextAuth configuration, JWT handling, session management
   ```

2. **Security Headers Integration Test**
   ```typescript
   // apps/web/src/__tests__/security.integration.test.ts
   // Test actual header implementation in responses
   ```

3. **Database Integration Tests**
   ```typescript
   // apps/web/src/lib/prisma.integration.test.ts
   // Test database connectivity, schema validation, basic CRUD
   ```

#### Short-term Additions (Medium Priority)

4. **Pre-commit Hook Validation**
   ```bash
   # scripts/test-pre-commit.sh
   # Test that pre-commit hooks actually execute and block commits
   ```

5. **Environment Configuration Tests**
   ```typescript
   // packages/config/src/index.test.ts
   // Test configuration validation and error handling
   ```

6. **End-to-end CI/CD Test**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/ci-cd-test.yml
   # Test complete pipeline execution and deployment validation
   ```

### Risk Assessment by Requirement
