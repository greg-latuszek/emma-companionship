**Story:** 1.1 Project Scaffolding & CI/CD Setup  

## Executive Summary

- **Total Risks Identified:** 12
- **Critical Risks:** 1
- **High Risks:** 2
- **Medium Risks:** 5
- **Low Risks:** 4
- **Risk Score:** 51/100 (Moderate Risk - Infrastructure Setup Complexity)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. [OPS-003]: CI/CD Pipeline Failure Blocking All Development

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability:** High (3) - Complex multi-service GitHub Actions workflow with PostgreSQL, Vercel integration  
**Impact:** High (3) - Complete development blockage, no deployments possible for entire team  

**Mitigation:**
- Implement incremental pipeline setup with fallback stages
- Create local development alternative to CI/CD dependency
- Setup pipeline monitoring and alerting from day one
- Document rollback procedures for pipeline failures

**Testing Focus:** 
- Test CI/CD pipeline in isolated repository first
- Validate PostgreSQL service connectivity independently
- Test Vercel deployment integration separately
- Create pipeline failure recovery scenarios

## High Risks (Score 6)

### 2. [TECH-001]: Monorepo Setup Complexity

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability:** Medium (2) - Turborepo + Next.js + TypeScript workspaces integration  
**Impact:** High (3) - Development environment instability, build failures  

**Mitigation:**
- Use proven Turborepo + Next.js templates as foundation
- Setup workspace dependencies incrementally
- Validate each package integration before adding next one
- Document exact setup steps for reproducibility

### 3. [BUS-001]: Foundation Delays Block Epic 1

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability:** Medium (2) - Infrastructure complexity can cause unexpected delays  
**Impact:** High (3) - All Epic 1 stories depend on this foundation  

**Mitigation:**
- Create minimal viable infrastructure first (basic Next.js + deployment)
- Implement incremental enhancement approach
- Setup parallel development tracks for non-infrastructure dependent tasks
- Define clear "done" criteria to prevent over-engineering

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **CI/CD Pipeline Resilience Testing**
  - Test pipeline failure scenarios and recovery
  - Validate PostgreSQL service connectivity under load
  - Test Vercel deployment rollback procedures
  - Simulate network failures during deployment
  - Test environment variable injection failures

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests  
- **Monorepo Integration Testing**
  - Validate workspace dependency resolution
  - Test Turborepo cache behavior across packages
  - Verify TypeScript workspace references compilation
  - Test cross-package import scenarios
- **Foundation Completeness Testing**
  - Verify all acceptance criteria met before story completion
  - Test Next.js app functionality end-to-end
  - Validate health check endpoint reliability

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Configuration Testing**
  - Test environment variable loading across environments
  - Validate Docker PostgreSQL container startup
  - Test build process performance benchmarks
- **Security Testing**
  - Verify no secrets leaked in CI/CD logs
  - Test basic Auth.js configuration security
  - Validate health check information disclosure

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- **OPS-003**: CI/CD pipeline failure - Implement robust error handling and rollback
- **TECH-001**: Monorepo setup - Ensure stable workspace configuration
- **BUS-001**: Foundation delays - Complete minimal viable infrastructure

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- **OPS-001, OPS-002**: Operational complexity - With documented procedures and monitoring
- **TECH-002, TECH-003**: Technical integration - With incremental validation approach

### Accepted Risks
- **SEC-001, SEC-002**: Basic security setup - Acceptable for development environment
- **PERF-001**: Build performance - Can optimize in subsequent stories

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **CI/CD Pipeline Health**: Success/failure rates, build times, deployment frequency
- **Monorepo Build Performance**: Build cache hit rates, compilation times
- **Environment Health**: Database connectivity, service availability
- **Developer Experience**: Setup time for new developers, error frequency

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- CI/CD pipeline configuration changes
- New packages added to monorepo
- Infrastructure provider changes (Vercel configuration)
- Database schema or connection changes
- Security requirements evolve
- Team size changes affecting development workflow

## Risk Mitigation Timeline

**Week 1 (Setup Phase)**
- Implement incremental CI/CD setup approach
- Create local development fallback procedures
- Setup basic monitoring and alerting

**Week 2 (Validation Phase)**  
- Complete integration testing of all components
- Validate rollback and recovery procedures
- Document operational procedures

**Ongoing**
- Monitor CI/CD pipeline health metrics
- Regularly review and update risk assessment
- Maintain operational documentation currency

## Additional Recommendations

### Development Process
1. **Incremental Implementation**: Build infrastructure incrementally rather than all-at-once
2. **Fallback Strategies**: Ensure local development works independent of CI/CD
3. **Documentation Priority**: Document setup procedures as you implement them
4. **Team Communication**: Regular check-ins during infrastructure setup phase

### Technical Recommendations  
1. **Pipeline Monitoring**: Implement GitHub Actions monitoring from day one
2. **Build Optimization**: Use Turborepo remote caching to improve performance
3. **Environment Parity**: Keep development/staging/production environments aligned
4. **Security Hardening**: Implement secrets scanning in CI/CD pipeline
