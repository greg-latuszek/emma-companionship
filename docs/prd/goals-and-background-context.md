# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

* Improve the operational efficiency of Companionship Delegates.
* Increase the percentage of "healthy" companionship relationships within the community.
* Ensure all eligible community members are assigned a Companion.
* Reduce the administrative burden and risk of burnout for Companions.

## Background Context

Companionship Delegates are responsible for managing a complex network of interpersonal relationships governed by strict constraints. The current manual process, often relying on spreadsheets, is inefficient and prone to error. This makes it difficult to track relationship health, find eligible companions, and prevent companion burnout.

This PRD will define a web application that models these relationships visually, providing delegates with dashboards and structured workflows. The goal is to create a tool that enforces the community's rules automatically and allows for efficient, effective management of the entire companionship system.
