# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The user experience should be clean, professional, and trustworthy, prioritizing clarity and efficiency for non-technical users. The interface must feel like a secure and reliable tool for managing sensitive information.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
The primary interaction model is "view then act." Users will view data on dashboards (lists and graphs) and then launch structured, wizard-style forms to perform actions. Graphs are for visualization and launching workflows, but also support "quick record" drag-and-drop for efficiency.

## Core Screens and Views
* Login Screen
* Main Dashboard (with links to key views)
* Province Member List
* **Companionship Graph View**
    * This view should be a useful graphical tool that allows a Delegate to:
        * See the complete companionship graph for all members of their province.
        * Select a person from a dropdown list to focus the graph on that specific node.
        * Filter the view to show only members who have Companions from another province.
        * Filter the graph to see only the members Accompanied by a specific Companion.
        * Filter the graph to show relationships for a specified type of Accompanied member (e.g., couple, priest, seminarian).
* Missing Companionship List
* Overwhelmed Companions List
* Member Profile Page (View/Edit)
* Assign Companion Workflow (Multi-step form/wizard)

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
The application should meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards to be accessible to all users.

## Branding
The visual design should align with the aesthetic and branding found on the main Emmanuel Community websites. Key references are:
* [https://emmanuel.info/en/](https://emmanuel.info/en/)
* [https://emmanuel.info/en/the-icone/](https://emmanuel.info/en/the-icone/)

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application must be a responsive web application, fully functional on both desktop and mobile browsers.
