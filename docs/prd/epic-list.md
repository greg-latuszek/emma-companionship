# Epic List

1.  **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Member Management**
    * **Goal**: Establish the project's technical foundation, implement user authentication and role-based access for Delegates, and provide the core functionality for creating and managing community members.

2.  **Epic 2: Basic Relationship Modeling & Visualization**
    * **Goal**: Implement the ability to manually create voluntary `companionship` relationships and automatically manage hierarchical `supervision` relationships, culminating in a view-only graph that displays both types.

3.  **Epic 3: High-Value Workflows**
    * **Goal**: With the basic viewing in place, deliver the two most critical time-saving features: the **Data Import** tool and the guided **Assignment Wizard**.

4.  **Epic 4: Advanced Graph Interaction**
    * **Goal**: Now that the core product is usable, enhance the graph with the **"quick record" drag-and-drop** feature, **manual health status tracking**, and powerful filtering capabilities.
