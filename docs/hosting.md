Tell me more about hosting on Vercel. How privacy is protected there. For POC I'd like like to start from local network just hosting inside local docker containers (as developers usually do during development). But to allow other (CD)s play with solution I need public URLs - it means some public cloud deployment - so, maybe Vercel is a choice. But I don't have agreement to publish community members sensitive data into Vercel. Can I deploy in such a way that even Vercel employees nor admins won't have access to community sensitive data? And what is Vercel hosting cost? Moreover can I use my own domain with some redirection to vercel? Or (in future) community domain/subdomain with redirection/proxy. And how about backups (critical companionship DB must be backuped in case of any crash of bug in some future application deployment that could devatate whole DB - let's prepare for the worst)

Of course. This is a critical set of questions that moves us from theory to practice. Let's do a deep analysis of using Vercel for your POC, focusing on your core concerns: privacy, cost, domains, and backups.

The short answer is **yes, Vercel is an excellent choice for this POC**, and we can address all your concerns. The key is understanding that Vercel handles the *application hosting*, while the *database* is a separate, though connected, service.

### üîí Data Privacy and Security

This is your most important question. Your goal is to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive community data, even by platform administrators. Here's how we achieve that.

1.  **Separation of Concerns**: Vercel hosts and runs our **Next.js application code**. The **PostgreSQL database**, where the sensitive member data is stored, is a separate service. When a user interacts with the app, the Vercel-hosted backend sends encrypted queries to the database provider.

2.  **Standard Encryption (The Baseline)**:
    * **Encryption in Transit**: All communication between the user's browser, the Vercel application, and the database is encrypted using **HTTPS/TLS**. This is standard and non-negotiable.
    * **Encryption at Rest**: Any reputable database provider, including Vercel's own PostgreSQL offering, encrypts your data when it's stored on their disks. This protects the physical data.

3.  **Your Core Question: Can Vercel Admins See the Data?**
    The honest answer is that with a standard setup, a privileged database administrator at the cloud provider could theoretically access the data in memory. This is true for nearly any managed database service you use.

    The technical solution to prevent even the provider from seeing the data is called **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**, where data is encrypted in the user's browser *before* it's even sent to our backend. However, implementing this is **extremely complex** and adds significant limitations.

    **My Recommendation for the POC**: We should rely on the robust, industry-standard security provided by the cloud vendor. We will sign a **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)** with them, which is a legal contract that governs how they handle your data and obligates them to protect its privacy. For the POC phase, this provides a very high level of security without the immense engineering overhead of building a full E2EE system.

### üí∞ Hosting Costs

You'll be pleased to know that the cost for a POC is likely **$0**.

* **Vercel Application Hosting**: Vercel's **Hobby tier is free**. It's incredibly generous and more than enough for a POC with your 115 delegate users.
* **Database Hosting**: Vercel also offers **Vercel Postgres**, which also has a **free Hobby tier**. This is a fully managed PostgreSQL database that is perfect for getting started.

So, we can launch and test this entire application with your users for a total cost of **$0/month**.

### üåê Custom Domains

**Yes, absolutely.** You can easily use your own domain or a community subdomain.

This is not a "redirection" or "proxy." You simply go into your domain registrar's settings (where you bought the domain) and point it directly to Vercel's servers. The Vercel dashboard provides simple, step-by-step instructions for this. You can use a main domain (`my-poc.com`) or a subdomain (`companionship.mycommunity.org`) without any issue.

### üíæ Database Backups

Backups are a function of the **database provider**, not the application host.

Any professional-grade database service, including Vercel Postgres, handles backups automatically. The key feature you need to know about is **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**. This means the system is constantly backing up your data, allowing you to restore the entire database to any specific second within a retention period (e.g., the last 7 days).

This protects you from:
* Accidental data deletion by a user.
* A bug in a new deployment that corrupts data.
* Any other catastrophic failure.

This is a standard feature and is your primary safety net.

### üèõÔ∏è Architectural Recommendation for the POC

Based on this analysis, here is my formal recommendation for deploying the POC:

1.  **Application Hosting**: Use the **Vercel Hobby (free) tier**.
2.  **Database**: Use the **Vercel Postgres Hobby (free) tier**. It's fully managed, includes backups, and is located in the same infrastructure as your application for the best performance.
3.  **Security**: We will rely on the standard HTTPS and Encryption-at-Rest provided by the platform, backed by a formal DPA. We will not build a custom E2EE system at this stage.
4.  **Domain**: We will use a custom domain you provide for professional access.

This approach is fast, secure, scalable, and has a starting cost of $0, making it ideal for your goal of gathering feedback from your delegate users.
