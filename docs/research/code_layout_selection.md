Or maybe we don't need Python for our project. Maybe typescript is enough. Next.js has server side. Will it also suit for building future extension of this application into mobile app? Maybe using react native?

---

Yes, a unified TypeScript stack is an excellent and highly pragmatic approach for this project. Your suggestion is a strong architectural move.

Let's break it down.

### Using a Single TypeScript Stack

Consolidating on Next.js for both frontend and backend is a modern, efficient strategy.

* **Simplified Development**: We'd use a single language (TypeScript) and package manager across the entire project. This improves developer experience and reduces context switching.
* **Code & Type Sharing**: This is the biggest advantage. We can define our data structures (like `Member`, `Companionship`, etc.) in one place and share them seamlessly between the frontend and backend. This completely eliminates a major source of bugs.
* **Simplified Tooling**: Our previous discussion about the complexity of a multi-language monorepo is now resolved. A pure TypeScript monorepo is much simpler to manage with modern tools.

The server-side capabilities of Next.js (API Routes) are more than powerful enough to handle the backend logic for this application.

---
### Future Mobile App Compatibility

To answer your questions directly:

* **Will the Next.js backend suit a future mobile app?**
    **Yes, absolutely.** The backend we build will expose a standard API. Any mobile application, whether it's built with React Native, Swift, or Kotlin, can communicate with this API. The backend is completely decoupled from the web frontend.

* **Could we use React Native?**
    **Yes, and it's a fantastic choice.** By using React Native, we could share even more code from our Next.js web appâ€”specifically business logic, data-fetching hooks, and potentially even some non-visual components. This would make developing the mobile app significantly faster.

---
### My Recommendation

I strongly recommend we adopt this unified TypeScript stack. The benefits for this project are significant.

This means our core architectural decisions are:
* **Full Stack Framework**: Next.js (React)
* **Language**: TypeScript
* **Repository**: Monorepo (now much simpler to implement)
* **Mobile Strategy**: The API will be designed to support a future React Native application, enabling high code reuse.

Does this unified TypeScript/Next.js approach sound like the definitive direction you'd like to take? If you agree, I'll finalize this introductory section, and we can proceed to designing the High-Level Architecture.

One more question: what technology stack is used by Microsoft Sharepoint? I'm asking since some of documents for (CD) are already stored at Community SharePoint. I'm wondering if that application (when done) could be deployed as SharePoint application/extension so that it will constitute one ecosystem. Question is if SharePoint uses Typescript or if allows some integration with typescript written apps.

---

Yes, that's a crucial question. The potential for integrating with an existing platform like SharePoint can significantly impact user adoption and workflow. Let's analyze its technology and what that means for our project.

### SharePoint's Technology Stack

Microsoft SharePoint's modern development model is called the **SharePoint Framework (SPFx)**. While SharePoint's backend is built on Microsoft technologies like ASP.NET and C#, the way you build *for* it is what's important to us.

The SharePoint Framework is a client-side development model that is built **entirely on TypeScript and open-source tooling**. It uses familiar web technologies, with **React** being the most popular and officially supported framework for building applications within it.

So, to answer your specific questions:
* **Does SharePoint use TypeScript?** Yes, the modern SharePoint Framework (SPFx) is built on TypeScript.
* **Does it allow integration with TypeScript apps?** Yes, you build SPFx applications *in* TypeScript.

---
### The Architectural Implications

This opens up a major architectural decision for us. We now have two distinct paths we can take:

**1. Standalone Application (Our Current Plan)**
This is what we've designed so far: a standard Next.js application with its own backend API.
* **Pros**: We have complete control over the technology, user interface, and hosting. It's a standard, independent web application.
* **Cons**: It exists outside of SharePoint. To integrate, users would need to go to a separate URL, and we would have to implement authentication with Microsoft's systems and use the Microsoft Graph API to access any documents stored in SharePoint.

**2. SharePoint Framework (SPFx) Application (A New Option)**
This would be a pivot. Instead of a standalone Next.js app, we would build a TypeScript/React application specifically *to be deployed inside SharePoint*.
* **Pros**:
    * **Seamless Integration**: The application would appear as a page or a component directly within your community's SharePoint site. Users would never leave the SharePoint environment.
    * **Automatic Authentication**: Users would already be logged into SharePoint, so no separate login for our app is needed.
    * **Easier Data Access**: Accessing documents and user information from SharePoint is much simpler and more direct.
* **Cons**:
    * **Architectural Pivot**: We would not use Next.js. We would use Microsoft's SPFx tooling. While we still use React and TypeScript, the project structure, backend logic (which would likely be Azure Functions), and deployment are completely different.
    * **Ecosystem Lock-in**: The application would be entirely dependent on the SharePoint environment.

---
### Recommendation

Given your goal for a single, integrated ecosystem where your delegates already work, **pivoting to the SharePoint Framework is a very strong strategic option**. The user experience would be far superior.

However, we must be clear that this is a significant change to our plan. We would be building an SPFx application, not a Next.js application.

Before we proceed, we need to make a decision. Would you like to:
1.  **Stay with the Standalone Next.js plan**, and treat SharePoint as an external system we might access for data?
2.  **Pivot to the SharePoint Framework (SPFx) plan**, and build the application to live *inside* SharePoint?

Before going widely public for all (CD)s via deploying to SharePoint I want to achieve good feedback from limited users pools. This will be POC. For that reason:

- I want to go with standalone next.js since I will have more control over it and I know this tech stack

- but in the same time I don't want to close door for SPFx development

My Idea is to hold on for now and go with deeper comparison of both environment searching how to find a way for most code reuse.

1. One idea is to use hexagonal architecture to be able to reuse whole business logic. However, I don't know how it maps to Modular Monolith. Or maybe because of that double-target-tech stack we need to switch to hexagonal. Or maybe Modular monolith is good enough for reusing domain business logic. Please do perform deep analysis on this topic and provide it to me for decision.

2. second point to research is database. I was wondering if Neo4j wouldn't be best choice for our application due to graph nature of companionship and supervision relations inside community. But I don't know if neo4j or any other graph database is available at SharePoint ecosystem. Do we have any backend DB available there at all or maybe it requires additional cost. Do we have graph or SQL databases. Even if our relations seems graph in nature it is not complicated set or nodes and relations so can be easily expressed inside SQL. I do know that Sharepoint as a basis is platform to store files. I can imagine application persistance as raw Excel file stored at sharepoint, or Microsoft Access single .mdb file, or single SQLite file with WAL mode and concurency implemented via @arcmantle/sqlite-wrapper TypeScript library. Especially last option is interesting since it might be shared between next.js and SPFx deployments (more code reuse). Please do perform deep analysis on this topic and provide it to me for decision.

3. taking into account our application_idea.md and prd.md as well as final decission to go with typescript only coding - provide me with more ideas for code reuse.

---

That's a very strategic way to approach this, and it gets to the heart of sustainable, long-term architecture. Your goal to start with a standalone Next.js app for the POC while planning for a potential SPFx future is wise. Maximizing code reuse is the key to making that pivot efficient.

Let's do a deep analysis of your first point: **Hexagonal Architecture vs. our existing Modular Monolith plan.**

---
### The Relationship: Modular Monolith vs. Hexagonal Architecture

It's helpful to think of these two concepts not as competitors, but as **complementary patterns that operate at different levels**. They solve different problems, and when used together, they are incredibly powerful.

* **Modular Monolith** is an **application-level structure**. Think of it as a blueprint for a house, defining the different rooms (modules like "Members," "Relationships," "Auth") and ensuring they have solid walls and clear doorways between them. Its main goal is to prevent the entire house from becoming one messy, open-plan space (a "spaghetti" monolith).

* **Hexagonal Architecture** (also known as Ports and Adapters) is a **module-level design pattern**. If the module is a room, Hexagonal Architecture is how we design the plumbing and electrical wiring *within that room*. Instead of hard-wiring a specific brand of faucet directly into the pipes, we install standard fittings (the **Ports**). We can then connect any brand of faucet that fits those standards (the **Adapters**).



The core of the hexagon is your pure, technology-agnostic **business logic**. The ports are the interfaces that define what the business logic needs (e.g., `iNeedToSaveThisRelationship`). The adapters are the concrete, technology-specific implementations that fulfill those needs (e.g., a `PrismaAdapter` that saves the relationship to a PostgreSQL database).

---
### Why Hexagonal is Crucial for Your Dual-Target Goal

Your question of whether a Modular Monolith is "good enough" on its own is insightful. **By itself, it is not.**

A Modular Monolith ensures your `Relationship` module is separate from your `Member` module. However, inside that `Relationship` module, the business logic could still be tightly coupled to a Next.js-specific technology, like the Prisma database client. You couldn't just lift that module and drop it into a SharePoint (SPFx) application.

This is where Hexagonal Architecture becomes the key. Let's analyze the two target environments:

1.  **Next.js Target**: The business logic runs on the **server**. Its "database adapter" will talk directly to our database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite).
2.  **SPFx Target**: The application is **client-side**, running in the user's browser. It has no direct access to a database. To save a relationship, its "database adapter" would actually be an **API adapter** that makes a `fetch` call to a backend API (like an Azure Function).

By designing our modules with the Hexagonal pattern:
* The **core business logic** (the hexagon) remains pure TypeScript, with no knowledge of Next.js, SharePoint, or any database. It is **100% reusable**.
* For our Next.js POC, we will write a **"Database Adapter"** that implements the data ports.
* If we pivot to SPFx, we keep the core logic untouched and simply write a new **"API Adapter"** that implements the same ports.

---
### Recommendation

My strong recommendation is that we refine our architectural plan. We are not choosing *between* these two ideas; we are **combining them**.

Our formal architectural approach will be: **We will build a Modular Monolith, and each module within it will be designed using the Hexagonal Architecture pattern.**

This gives us the organizational benefits of the Modular Monolith while providing the critical, technology-agnostic isolation of our business logic, which is the key to achieving your goal of maximum code reuse and keeping the door open for SharePoint.
